# CDD

Official code of the Cat Drug Dealer game written by ElectraFossil, Car352Tearful, and CoolBudy1.

# Render Engine

The render engine was built using LWJGL 3.3, which contains libraries such as OpenGL, and OpenCV. 

The render engine is designed for a 2D game, but uses 3D vectorial positions to simulate depth.

# Collision Engine

The collision engine takes an input from a color coded map and uses OpenCV to create the desired colliders. (Written by CoolBudy1, Implemented by Car352Tearful)
